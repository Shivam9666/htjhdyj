                        Any natural substance that humans use can be considered a natural resource. 
                        Oil, coal, natural gas, metals, stone and sand are natural resources. 
                        Other natural resources are air, sunlight, soil and water.
                         Animals, birds, fish and plants are natural resources as well.

                        प्राकृतिक संसाधन वे संसाधन हैं जो प्रकृति से लिए गए हैं और कुछ संशोधनों के साथ उपयोग किए जाते हैं। 
                        इसमें वाणिज्यिक और औद्योगिक उपयोग, सौंदर्य मूल्य, वैज्ञानिक रुचि और सांस्कृतिक मूल्य जैसी मूल्यवान विशेषताओं के स्रोत शामिल हैं।

                        Natural resources are resources that are drawn from nature and used with few modifications. This includes the sources of valued characteristics such as commercial and industrial use, aesthetic value, scientific interest, and cultural value. On Earth, it includes sunlight, atmosphere, water, land, all minerals along with all vegetation, and wildlife

                        Natural resources are part of humanity's natural heritage or protected in nature reserves. Particular areas (such as the rainforest in Fatu-Hiva) often feature biodiversity and geodiversity in their ecosystems. Natural resources may be classified in different ways. Natural resources are materials and components (something that can be used) found within the environment. Every man-made product is composed of natural resources (at its fundamental level).

                        A natural resource may exist as a separate entity such as freshwater, air, or any living organism such as a fish, or it may be transformed by extractivist industries into an economically useful form that must be processed to obtain
                         the resource such as metal ores, rare-earth elements, petroleum, timber and most forms of energy. 
                        Some resources are renewable, which means that they can be used at a certain rate and natural processes will restore them. In contrast, many extractive industries rely heavily on non-renewable resources that can only be extracted once.

                        The ocean is an example of a natural resource. Ocean waves can be used to generate wave power, a renewable energy source. Ocean water is important for salt production, desalination, and providing habitat for deep-water fishes.
                         There is biodiversity of marine species in the sea where nutrient cycles are common.

                        These resources are formed over a long geological time period in the environment and cannot be renewed easily. Minerals are the most common resource included in this category. From the human perspective, resources are non-renewable when their rate of consumption exceeds the rate of replenishment/recovery; a good example of this is fossil fuels, which are in this category because their rate of formation is extremely slow (potentially millions of years), meaning they are considered non-renewable.
                         Some resources naturally deplete in amount without human interference, the most notable of these being radio-active elements such as uranium, which naturally decay into heavy metals. Of these, the metallic minerals can be re-used by recycling them,[5] but coal and petroleum cannot be recycled.

                Resource extraction involves any activity
                 that withdraws resources from nature. This can range in scale from the traditional use of preindustrial societies to global industry. Extractive industries are, along with agriculture, the basis of the primary sector of the economy. Extraction produces raw material, which is then processed to add value. Examples of extractive industries are hunting, trapping, mining, oil and gas drilling, and forestry. Natural resources can add substantial amounts to a country's wealth;[7] however, a sudden inflow of money caused by a resource boom can create social problems including inflation harming other industries ("Dutch disease") and corruption, leading to inequality and underdevelopment,
                 this is known as the "resource curse".
